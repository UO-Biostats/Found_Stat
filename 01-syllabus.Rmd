Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this course is being delivered entirely remotely. We realize that this situation makes it difficult for some students to interact with the material, for a variety of reasons. We are committed to flexibility during this stressful time and emphasize that we will work with students to overcome difficult barriers as they arise.
